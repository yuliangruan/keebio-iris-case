# Summary

Case for the Iris keyboard Rev2 from keeb.io. Wanted the feel of a complete and robust product that you can put in your bag without fear of damaging the insides. Additionally I wanted it to print without supports and have the ability to modify the bottom after assembly.

Specs:
5.2 degree incline
3.0 degree tent

For building you need to print:
1x topLeft
1x topLeft mirrored
1x bottomLeftSupport or 1x bottomLeft
1x bottomRightSupport or 1x bottomRight
2x reset
and buy:
20x M2x12mm
20x M2 nuts

The top part is the same for both left and right, so just mirror one in the slicer.
The bottom part is either a minimal case (bottomLeft and bottomRight) or a version with a slight tent, angle and wrist supports (bottomLeftSupport and bottomRightSupport).
None of the bottom parts can be mirrored since the usb and trrs jacks are not in the same location for left and right.

The outline and the holes are based on the official iris github files, meaning you could potentially use an already assembled iris top part with the bottom part of this case.

Tested with iris kit, pro micros and trrs cable from keeb.io. Make sure your components fit before you print.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: i3 MK3
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.1
Infill: 15%

Notes: 
Used combine infill 2 in slic3r prusa to shave off some 2h for the bottomSupport parts

# Post-Printing

Might be smart to check that the M2 nuts fit in their slots before you assemble the keyboard, since it is easier to remove potential stray plastic before the buttons are installed.
